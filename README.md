A search engine used to search for gifs using the GIPHY api, simply type into the search bar and press submit to find gifs that relate.

Technologies used:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

User stories:

As a user I want to be able to search for my favorite gifs.

As a user I want a simple and clean website to use, I don’t like it too complicated.

As a user I want to be able to see multiple gifs at once.

Ideas for future improvement:
- Make the site display the gifs in a better format
- Have the site clear out previous results each time a search is done
- Improve the site's aesthetics, like matching the navbar to the background, or experimenting with the text font and placement.
